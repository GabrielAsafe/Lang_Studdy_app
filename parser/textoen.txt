HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL COULD YOU BE NOW YOU'RE EATING PEACHES FOR BREAKFAST
and I am licking you out like a pan glinting I turn all your stories
round the beating part of me

muted living tires me out and the green parakeets tell me I must be quick
they emphasise that haste is required

I pour myself out all over you like something for which I'd still like to find a metaphor
the days are sweet I pick them
cook them down thick to syrup
add too much sugar again leave it sitting there night after night
tea towel over the top as though this will somehow protect us from the insects

how much more beautiful could you be and the procession of ants
winding across the tile floor
